# BrainInspiredPINN
This is accomponaying notebook to the paper *Brain-Inspired Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Compact and Modular Architectures*.

The major goal of this work is to merge traditional Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) methods and Brain-Inspired Modular Training to allow for PINN architectures that evolve during the training and present modular and compact structures. We show that BIMT introduces a dynamically changing architecture with a highly sparse and modular architecture, resembling traditional numerical approaches, at the cost of a slight loss of accuracy. We also use brain-inspired PINNs to derive primitive building blocks we can reuse for the construction of larger PINNs, which we call modular PINNs.
